<i>[Randall Kennedy](https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10470/Kennedy) is the Michael R. Klein Professor at Harvard Law School where he teaches courses on contracts, criminal law, and the regulation of race relations. We recently talked about why he started using H2O, how he approaches contracts law with his students, and how H2O allows him to customize and adjust his course over time. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</i> 

### Briefly, what courses are you currently teaching or preparing to teach?

I’m teaching contracts, I’m teaching a course about the second reconstruction in America, and I’m teaching a course in the winter term on the regulation of policing. 

### You started using H2O in 2019 for your Contracts course - what prompted you to transition your course material into H2O?

I was at a lunch and Charles Fried was talking about how pleased he was that he had put together his own materials, and he mentioned that the library had helped him publish his own casebook. He was very enthused about that and I sent off for the book - I thought, let me take a look. And I looked through his book and thought that it was really cool. So, I imitated. I thought, gosh, I’m going to do this. Then I called up the library folks and asked how to do this, they told me how the process would go, we came up with a timeline, and we made it happen.

Up until then I had been using a casebook that I really liked. I really liked the authors, too, who were very responsive to my questions when I was using it, and it had been working well for me. But I was aware of the expense - these casebooks are very expensive, so that was on my mind.

And then I guess it was just the fun of doing something different, and doing something that was completely tailored to exactly what I wanted to do. So once I was told what it would entail, you know, it was a lot of work. But it was good work, it didn’t scare me, and it wasn’t overwhelming. So I did it. And then I revised it for a second edition last year, and I’m in the process of revising it a third time this year. 

Everytime I teach the class new things will come up, I’ll add new cases, sometimes the cases I teach don’t generate the discussion I want so I’ll drop cases. It’s highly malleable - it’s like a bespoke suit. Tailor made. I’m very happy that I’ve gone down this road. 

### What changed, if anything, about your teaching once you started to use H2O?

I don’t think my basic teaching changed. I do think that the pressure of putting together the materials did force me to think more. If you’re confronting a casebook that’s already put together, you know, you’re thinking about it, but it's a room that’s already furnished. So you might get an accent desk or you might get a rug, but it’s already arranged for you. Versus, when you’re building your own book, you walk in and it’s not furnished. There are walls and a floor and what not, but you have to put in the clock, you have to put in the carpet, you have to figure out where people are going to sit. And so in that sense, it’s just a different process. 

So thinking about all of that, creating my own casebook does prompt me to think more about my subject. And then every time I make my revisions, which right now I’m looking at finishing up by late summer, that has a good effect, too, because by late spring or early summer I’ll really have to attend to my contracts class and think about it in a deeper way than I otherwise would have. So by the time September rolls around I will have had to think about the cases, will have had to do the spadework, that I wouldn’t really have had to do if I just said, everyone order your casebook and make sure it arrives by September. It’s making me attend to the subject more deeply than I otherwise would.

### Your book is called “Heartbreak and Happiness” - can you talk a bit about your perspective on contract law and how that is reflected in your book?

The cases that I find most memorable in contracts are the cases involving intimate transactions. So, breach of promise to marry, or prenuptial agreements, or palimony suits. 

I tell students early on, before anybody has done any reading I'll say, listen to two songs and these two songs are going to be in the backdrop of our study on contracts. Song number one is Ruby and the Romantics “Our Day Will Come”. It's a wonderful song in which people are falling in love and they’re anticipating wonderful times ahead and everything is just great. And that’s song number one. And what I say is, when you enter into a deal, and I don't care what the deal is, you could be ordering a burger at a restaurant, and you’re thinking this is going to be the best burger you’ve ever had. If you buy a refrigerator or an oven, you have really high hopes for that purchase. And if you’re in a relationship, you’re going in with really high hopes. The second song is “The Thrill is Gone”, the original version by B.B. King. And so, what I tell students is that when a deal goes bad, the thrill is gone. The deal didn’t work out the way you thought. Happiness, and then heartbreak. So, when I put together the casebook I’m especially attentive to cases where the dispute is intimate in nature. 

Now, of course, we cover business cases too. But I’d say more than the typical casebook we will deal with these questions of contracting in the shadow of intimate association. That’s of particular interest. 

### You've already created a second edition of your book, and are working on a third - can you talk a bit more about what kinds of things are you changing year to year?

I’ll read a case and I’ll think, this is a good case, I’m going to put this in the casebook. And then we roll around to class and when it comes time to actually talk about the case in class, what looks to be an interesting case turns out to be a dud. 

For instance, there is a case in the first two editions of my book involving the rapper 50 Cent. It was a palimony case. And I thought, he’s a rapper, the students probably know who he is and will be interested in him. The case talked about his background which is pretty colorful, and I thought they’d be interested. But I’m going to drop the case this year because it just wasn’t prompting the discussion I thought it would. 

Class is a nice test for cases. I put them in the book because I think they’ll be vehicles for discussion. If they’re not, I’m going to drop them. The great thing about H2O is, fine, boom, I’m taking it out. Done.

### Do you have any advice for professors or instructors considering open casebooks and H2O? Anything you wish you had known going into it?

I’m a big proponent of it. I think it's great. People have asked me and I’ve told people at Harvard and other places as well that I think it's wonderful. I wish I could have done it 20 years ago. I feel it has definitely enhanced my experience and the experience of my students.
