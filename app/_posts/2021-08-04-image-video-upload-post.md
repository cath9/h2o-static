Spurred in part by the remote learning environment of the past year, educators have increasingly come to rely on H2O as a primary teaching tool and have been eager to incorporate more of their open educational content in one place. Today we're announcing that H2O authors now have the ability to upload images and embed videos in their casebooks alongside other materials like cases, U.S. code, text, and links. 

With these new multimedia options in H2O, authors are able to use the text editor to upload images like flowcharts, sketches, photographs, and anything else that helps them support a concept in their book (see sample image below). Authors are also able to embed any video from Vimeo or YouTube they’d like to use to illustrate a topic they are teaching. This includes their own video lectures, but could also include other publicly available videos related to their topic.

Complementing this change, we have adapted our "Text" resources to be called "Custom Content". These resources now feature a responsive tag that will adapt based on the type of content authors include. For example, a resource that only includes text will be tagged as such in the main casebook view.

A resource that includes video or images will instead be tagged as multimedia.
